This version ended up being a \\\\"smaller\\\\" sized release, plenty of new things but a lot of the major new additions\\\\/enhancements ended up being very time consuming. By the time this is being read, we will already be starting on planning for 3.0.4 and 3.0.5 - the former may be a medium-large sized release.<\\\\/p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>Release highlights:<\\\\/p>\\\\r\\\\n<ul>\\\\r\\\\n<li>Article Enhancements - There was a lot added to improve the functionality of managing articles in the admin. You can preview an article as you edit it, revisions have been adding allowing a history of an article to be managed. With the new revisions, users can now choose a quick save and auto-save method to allow for quick and easy saving without leaving the page - in addition, revisions can be previewed.<\\\\/li>\\\\r\\\\n<li>Bootstrap\\\\/FontAwesome Upgrade - The admin look and feel has been updated to the newest version of Bootstrap. Since bootstrap 3.0 is very different and fontawesome also changed their naming conventions, we decided it was a good time to upgrade. The design is largely around the same as before, but the main admin page has been upgraded and the overall look\\\\/feel is \\\\"bigger\\\\" and less round, which is the Boostrap 3 look.<\\\\/li>\\\\r\\\\n<li>Addon Creator - A fairly big feature, the addon creator is a new feature written in AngularJS that will provide an easy interface to create a plugin or theme. The main purpose of the app is to make it easy to create either, along with providing the ability to do most things inside AdaptCMS without having to edit files via FTP. The first version is fairly simple, but we have plans to expand it over time.<\\\\/li>\\\\r\\\\n<li>Media Libraries - The \\\\"media modal\\\\" was recoded into angularJS, making it a quicker and very stable feature now. Libraries can also now be linked to articles, providing the functionality of linking to a list of libraries, showing numerous images or the latest image from linked libraries on an article page. Very useful for video game websites.<\\\\/li>\\\\r\\\\n<\\\\/ul>\\\\r\\\\n<p>With the release of 3.0.3, the documentation has also been update covering a lot of areas, this can be viewed here:<\\\\/p>\\\\r\\\\n<p><a href=\\\\"http:\\\\/\\\\/documentation.adaptcms.com\\\\/3.0.3\\\\/Setup\\\\/Installation\\\\" target=\\\\"_blank\\\\">http:\\\\/\\\\/documentation.adaptcms.com\\\\/3.0.3\\\\/Setup\\\\/Installation<\\\\/a><\\\\/p>\\\\r\\\\n<p>You can also see a full list of changes below:<\\\\/p>\\\\r\\\\n<p><a href=\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/github.com\\\\/adaptcms\\\\/AdaptCMS\\\\/blob\\\\/3.0.3\\\\/CHANGELOG.md\\\\" target=\\\\"_blank\\\\">https:\\\\/\\\\/github.com\\\\/adaptcms\\\\/AdaptCMS\\\\/blob\\\\/3.0.3\\\\/CHANGELOG.md<\\\\/a><\\\\/p>"},"site-blogs":{"id":"282","title":"AdaptCMS 3.0.3 - January 18th","slug":"adaptcms-3-0-3-january-18th","tags":"[\\\\"angularjs\\\\",\\\\"bootstrap\\\\",\\\\"addon-creator\\\\",\\\\"articles\\\\",\\\\"article-revisions\\\\",\\\\"fontawesome\\\\"]","related_articles":"","user_id":"1","category_id":"4","status":"1","publish_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","settings":"{\\\\"comments_status\\\\":\\\\"open\\\\",\\\\"permissions\\\\":{\\\\"2\\\\":{\\\\"view\\\\":{\\\\"status\\\\":\\\\"1\\\\"}},\\\\"3\\\\":{\\\\"view\\\\":{\\\\"status\\\\":\\\\"1\\\\"}},\\\\"4\\\\":{\\\\"view\\\\":{\\\\"status\\\\":\\\\"1\\\\"}},\\\\"1\\\\":{\\\\"view\\\\":{\\\\"status\\\\":\\\\"1\\\\"}}}}","created":"2014-01-18 11:13:04","modified":"2014-01-18 11:13:39","deleted_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","article_id":"114","field_id":"12","file_id":"0","data":"<p>After the release of 3.0.2, work started days after on the next release.
